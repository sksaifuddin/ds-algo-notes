# Data structures and Algorithms notes 📓⌨️💥
I have tried to learn Ds and Algo so many times and its always difficult to maintain the consistency 🥲. One more big reason is I always try to complete a topics and then move to another by completing all easy, medium and hard questions, which takes lot of time and I give up and stop practising. This is why I never came to the advance topics like tree and dynamic programming.

This time I will try to maintain consistency and do the problems with this flow:
### Easy (all topics) -> Medium (all topics) -> Hard (all topics) -> Competitive programming 💥🧑‍💻

Also take detailed notes, which will be combination of code and theory. I will also try to write some blogs and explain others about the topics I learn to make journey more enjoyable.

** Most important thing: Practice Daily !!!! **

# 💪 Strategy: 
1. Study the topic or the algorithm
2. Easy questions from leetcode
3. Take detailed notes of all topics and all the problems solved (really important)
4. Keep revising notes every weekend
5. Complete all topics with solved easy questions
6. Do medium questions
7. Do Hard questions
8. Start doing random questions / participate in coding competitions
9. Keep practising and keep revising
10. Have fun !!!

# 📔 Topics to be covered: (some topics may be added)
Remember the flow: Easy -> Medium -> Hard
1. Big O
2. Arrays
3. Two pointers
4. Multi dimension arrays
5. Recursion
6. Island (Matrix Traversal)
7. Sliding window
8. Strings
9. LinkedList
10. Stack
11. queue
12. Trees
13. Sorting and Searching
14. Dynamic Programming
